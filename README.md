## **MyStat API .NET Core** 
**Author**: [Leonid List](https://t.me/leonidlist)

MyStat is a unique student service designed and used at the STEP Computer Academy (https://itstep.org). Officially MyStat has Andoid/iOS application and Web Version. But I want to create API that all developers using C# can use it.
